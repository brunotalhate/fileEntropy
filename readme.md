# File Entropy

**This project is supposed to work on python 3. Get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).**

Once installed, download this repo and run it:

`$ python entropy.py` wich will use default file path `'./files/file.txt'`

To use your own file path, use `$ python entropy.py <file_path>`
